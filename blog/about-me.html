  <h3> Who is AgileBelma?</h3>

  <h4>Linguist</h4>
  <p>Started learning languages when I was 11 and started interpreting 'unofficially' when I was 12, so I kind of 'fell' into
    it. But I think it was mostly because I had wonderful language tutors throughout high school, who inspired me to be curious
    about many different languages and cultures. I'm still learning languages as it's my mission to do so until I physically
    can't.</p>

  <h4>Teacher and Researcher</h4>
  <p>I've wanted to be a teacher since I was 6 but became a professional academic about twenty years ago. I couldn't believe
    I was actually getting paid to teach and conduct research! Again, I was inspired by former teachers, lecturers and academics
    who showed me that if you have a passion for anything, you could actually pass it onto others. Learning is contagious.</p>

  <h4> Padawan Web Developer </h4>
  <P> I hold this role to be very similar to the first one as I'm learning a lot of syntax, semantics and lexical sets at the
    moment, which is my comfort zone. But it is still the syntax, semantics and lexical sets of another language, namely
    JavaScript, and this is the difficult part.</P>

  <p>This website is a collection of my reflections as I travel on this winding road of becoming a web developer as a student
    of EDA. It may take a while so be patient with me. The semantic tags are almost in place but CSS is still work in progress
    as you can see. All feedback is welcome to improve my site, as long as you find me on Twitter @AgileBelma (I can't create
    web forms yet ;-) </p>

  <p>Thank you for reading thus far</p>
