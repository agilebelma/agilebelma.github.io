    <p> What learnings did you take from the chapter?</p>
    <p> Emotional Intelligence is about monitoring your feelings, monitoring others' feelings, and guiding your actions according to what you've been monitoring</p>
    <p> So, it is based on a 'dynamic state' a bit like some websites. Emotions can be highly volatile and totally unpredictable. Therefore it is important to 'keep your cool' and show some empathy to others (put yourself in their shoes and try to see the situation from their perspective first)</p>
    <p> If things are getting tougher, show some grit - be patient and persistent but know to walk away to let some steam out. Then come back and look at the problem from another view point</p>

    <p>How did you find the two minutes of mindfulness?</p>
    <p> I like it very much! It's like the 'reboot' function on a computer. Our brains can get clogged up easily, just like the CPUs. SO, every now and then we need to re-set, take time off, and ground ourselves. I try to meditate 10 mins a day and it calms me down immensely</p>
