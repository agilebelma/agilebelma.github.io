  <p>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</p>
  <p> So far, I've only completed the site redesign task, which took me 3 hrs. The suggested timeframe was 1.5 hrs. I've spent more time refreshing my mind about the steps I needed so I felt obliged to watch the Udacity videos. However, I'm confident about the steps, despite drawing really awful wireframes for my site! I've made a change to one of them already!</p>
