  <h2> Process over product</h2>
  <h3> 26 September 2017</h3>

  <h4>How did the 'process over product' concept affect the way you tackled the site redesign and rebuild?</h4>
    <p> So far, I've only completed the site redesign task, which took me 3 hrs. The suggested timeframe was 1.5 hrs. I've spent more time refreshing my mind about the steps I needed so I felt obliged to watch the Udacity videos. However, I'm confident about the steps, despite drawing really awful wireframes for my site! I've made a change to one of them already!</p>

  <h4>What did you think about meditation before reading chapter 2?</h4>
    <P> Pure luxury!!!</P>

  <h4>What new things have you learnt about meditation?</h4>
    <p>Meditation is a state of being 'relaxed and alert at the same time', which is essential for web developers as they need to be flexible but firm in their approach to web design and development</p>
    <p>When you're aware of your attention and meta-attention, you're focused and stable, calm and clear. The analogy I use to describe achieving this calm state is the snow-flake domes as tourist souvenirs. When you shake them, the 'snow flake' is like a storm inside, and slowly settles on the bottom, creating a snowy village picture. The mind works in a similar way in that it can get turbulent, and it needs to be grounded to process more information.</p>
    <p> Meditation develops your muscle of attention to overcome resistance - just like working out in a gym (Chp 2).

  <h4> The Process Model of Mindfulness Meditation</h4>
    <p> Intention > Attention > Cognitive Process > Attitude </p>
    <p> Follow Breath > Distraction > Regain Attentional Focus </p>

  <h4> Distractions </h4>
    <ol>
      <li>Acknowledge</li>
      <li>Experience without judging or reacting</li>
      <li>If you need to react, continue maintaining mindfulness</li>
      <li>Let it go</li>
    </ol>
