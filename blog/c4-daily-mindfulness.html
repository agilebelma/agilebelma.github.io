<h3> Chapter 3 - Search Inside Yourself </h3>

<h4> What did you learn from your 'mindfulness conversation'?</h4>
 <p>That when you listen you learn something new. But when you speak, you just repeat what you already know (Dalai Lama).</p>
<p>A good conversation requires effort. If you allow your mind to wander whilst the other person is speaking, then there won't be a conversation. So the following is recommended:</p>
<ol>
  <li>mindful listening</li>
  <li>looping</li>
  <li>dipping</li>
</ol>

<h4> How did the other person find it?</h4>
  <p>I think he really enjoyed the undivided attention, especially when I was able to summarise the key points he made. He was also happy to return the favour of paying undivided attention when I spoke. </p>

<h4> Which of the 3 suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
  <p>All of them! Always on the lookout for conversation buddies. It's only for 15 mins a week so highly feasible. Keep meditations short but consistent thorughout the week. Last but not least, take at least one breath a week! One that I'm fully aware of. Yes, that is my intention for each week.</p>
  <p> I'm aiming to achieve sukha "non-energatic joy" by practising focused and open attention regularly.</p>

<h4> Any other musings?</h4>
  <p> I had an appointment at the hospital for 2.30pm. I was told to wait in the waiting area, and was called in at 3pm! I had 2 choices really - either to get angry and worked up about the delays in the public health system, or medidate using the techniques from Chp 3, which is appropriately titled 'Mindfulness without butt or cushion'. I opted for the latter and felt so good as a result! Highly recommend it fo those highly frustrating but unavoidable situations in life.</p>
