<h3> Chapter 4 - Search Inside Yourself </h3>

<h4> Self-confidence</h4>
 <p>"It takes profound self-confidence to be humble enough to recognize your own limitations without self-blame" - Norman Fischer</p>
<p>"You cannot solve a problem with the same mind that created it" - Albert Einstein</p>

<h4> Self-awareness</h4>
<p> "knowing one's internal states, preferences, resources and intuitions" - Daniel Goleman</p>

<p>Self-awareness competencies</p>
<ol>
  <li>Emotional awareness</li>
  <li>Accurate self-assessment aka "self-objectivity"</li>
  <li>Self-confidence</li>
</ol>

<h4> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self-awareness?</h4>
  <p> Mindfulness is type of strategy to pull yourself out of a tight situation, and self-awareness is knowing that you are in a tight situation as well as knowing all the resources that are available to you to get you out of that tight situation. Knowing your strengths and weaknesses</p>
  <p>Both mindfulness and self-awareness are 'trainable' qualities</p>

<h4> Body Scan</h4>
  <p>Starting from the top, going all the way to the tip of the toes, bringing attention to your whole body without any judgment</p>
  <p>This takes time getting used to but I use an app to talk me through it. I actually tried this technique at the airport, after my flight was cancelled. Whilst I was waiting, I did a body scan in about 5 mins. I had to wait at the queue to transfer the flight to another day for over 2 hours! So the 5 mins I spent on body scan was the best investment ever!</p>

<h4> Journalling</h4>
  <p> I love journalling! Things have a habit of going around in circles in your head! Well, in my head anyway. So, when I finally get them off my chest, I feel great, really do. Journalling helps me re-assess my situation and re-ground emotions just like doing a body scan.</p>

<h4>"My emotions are Not Me"</h4>
<p>Sometimes my emotions feel like a snow globe, like the tourist souvenir that you shake and it looks like snowing on the inside. I need a moment or two to settle that snow storm inside me. The feeling can be over-powering, almost nauseating, and that is not me, but how I'm made to feel physically. It feels frustrating because I cannot control it, especially when it is imposed.</p>
<p> I must get onto CSS - this site looks awful!!</p>
