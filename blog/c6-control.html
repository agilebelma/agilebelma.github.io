<h3> Chapter 5 - Search Inside Yourself </h3>

<h4> Self-mastery </h4>

<h5>When programming, what are some of your triggers? What causes a disproportionate emotional response?</h5>
<p>Frustration out of being careless. How could I get that wrong, again? I just must accept that this is all part of the learning process, and move on. It'll probably happen again, and again. I must accept it and learn from it.</p>

<h5>How did you find the Siberian North Railroad exercise? (Stop, Breathe, Notice, Reflect, Respond)</h5>

<p>It's a routine, and humans are creatures of habit. I think I can get used to it, and use it to ground my nerves. I like it. I've also been trying to see things from other people's perspectives. I try to see them as a 'friend' rather than foe and look at options to resolve or diffuse the situation. It's not always easy, but it helps. And, yes, humour is also absolutely essential in every tricky situation.</p>




<p> I must get onto CSS - this site looks awful!!</p>
