<h5> "If we treat people with kindness and empathy, we create trust and understanding" Chade-Meng Tan </h5>

<h6> Have you tried using any of the insight and techniques for growing trust and sincerity? How did it go?</h6>

<p>Yes! I was absolutely furious with a colleague, so much so I almost avoided going to the team meeting, in order to avoid the colleague. But, few minutes into the meeting [it was one of those meetings that required a break half way through], I decided get a cup of coffee. On the way back, I passed my colleague, and decided to make a peace offering, by offering a cup of coffee to the same colleague. It somehow felt good to get rid of my 'Darth Vader' thoughts and use the force for good. It just took a cup of coffee to feel the force!</p>

<h6> Try empathic listening - how did it go?</h6>
<ol>
  <li>Mindfulness</li>
  <li>Kindness</li>
  <li>Curiosity</li>
  <li>Practice</li>
</ol>

<p>A new colleague had to go away to another town for the funeral of a family member. When he came back, I had a chance to ask him how he was. I thought it was appropriate despite not knowing him well. I asked with kindness. He was surprised but seemed happy to be asked. I then asked him about the family member who passed away. We sat down in the lunch room and talked about his uncle for about 20 mins or so. I got to meet the new staff member and found out about his uncle too. It wasn't easy to get started but he appreciated the time and attention. I think I would too.</p>

<h6> How did you find the loving kindness meditation?</h6>

<p> "Kindness is a sustainable source of happiness" Tan, 144</p>
<p>Metta Bhavana - </p>
<ul>
  <li>May I be well</li>
  <li>May I be happy</li>
  <li>May I be free from suffering</li>
</ul>
<p>I like the loving kindness meditation but whether I'll be practising it properly is another matter. I think it's really hard to 'love' someone and show kindness to that person who has caused you so much strife! But, tryin to see things from their perspective is a good starting point.</p>
