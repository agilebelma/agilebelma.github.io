    <h4>Leadership</h4>

    <h5>What is your experience of compassionate (or not) leadership?</h5>

    <h6> Managers are made, Leaders are born</h6>

    <p> I've had the fortune of working with a number of managers, some of whom have been great leaders. What separates them
        is their compassion. Compassion for their work, staff and what they want to leave behind.</p>
    <p>One of the departments I worked in had a change over, including a new manager, whom I've never met as I was in hospital
        when he started working. I received an email from him, asking me how I was doing after the operation, and whether
        it was appropriate to visit me. I thought to myself 'Wow! We've never met but he genuinely cares about me, even though
        I may never be able to go back to work.' He didn't have to do any of that. He could have just focussed on the members
        of staff who were 'fully operational'.</p>
    <p>On another occasion, in another lifetime, in another department, I had to take time off work, and sent an email to my
        manager that I'd be at least a week off my duties. The reply was short and sweet: 'Do you have a medical certificate?'
        That was it, no how are you or hope you feel better soon, but straight to the practicalitiies. I suppose he had to
        file the documents in a safe place.</p>
    <p> So, what is the moral of the story? Is there one? I'm learning to look and cnsider all perspectives as part of my mindfulness
        training. But I really can't figure out the reply I received, nor explain the reason for it. I've tried really hard.Let me move on...</p>
    
    <h5>How did you find the multiplying goodness meditation?</h5>

    <p> It was extrememly relaxing. I also felt 'free' as I was able to let go of many things (see above). It provides a way to work through injustices, unfairness, laternative agendas. It allows me to let go of my ego.</p>

    <h5> How did you find the Tonglen meditation?</h5>

    <p> It took a while to get used it but it was worth it at the end. I helps to get rid of the negative energy surrounding us, and turning it into positive energy.</p>

    <h5>How does the SCARF model apply to your Phase 0 experience so far? How will it apply to bootcamp?</h5>
    
    <ol>
        <li>Status</li>
        <li>Certainty</li>
        <li>Autonomy</li>
        <li>Relatedness</li>
        <li>Fairness</li>

    </ol>
    
    <p>Well, I think I'm officially a scarfie now! Phase 0 has been a huge jigsaw puzzle for me. The firends I've made, and those friends I haven't met yet from the bootcamp, have been gerat at easing the pain of putting the jigsaw puzzle together. Without those friends, it would have been a lonely journey, which may not have been completed alone. I can't wait till the bootcamp!</p>

    <h5>Have a difficult converstaion. How did it go?</h5>

    <p> I'd like to start by saying that one never looks forward to having a difficult conversation. I was avoiding this conversation but finally took the plunge. Also took some deep breaths. I tried, really hard, to see the situation from the other person's perspective. I accepted that he was a human, with needs and wants, and limitations. I listened first and foremost. I acknowledged what he said, and showed respect. It was genuine, and I think he could see that. So when it was my turn, he also listened. It was a fruitful conversation.</p>
