    <p> Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to your non-technical friend?</p>

    <p>When we talk about linguistics, we refer to 'Parts of Speech' to describe the different sections. For example, noun, adjective, verb. These sections make up the whole language, enabling us to communicate.</p>
    <p>In web development, we have different parts that put a website together.</p>
    <p>So, we can refer to HTML as the noun of web development, as it tells us 'What' a part or a component is on the webpage.</p>
    <p>CSS is the adjective of web development, as it describes the noun (HTML).</p>
    <p>JaveScript is the verb, as it tells us about the actions on a webpage (but I'll come back to JS later on.</p>
    <p>Finally, we have DOM, which is the equivalent of the 'Phrase Structure' or 'Syntactic Categories' in linguistics. It's a tree with branches that breaks down a sentence. For example a simple 'Sentence' consists of a 'Noun Phrase' NP and a 'Verb Phrase' VP. We can break down NP further into an optional 'Adjective Phrase' AP and a 'Prepositional Phrase' PP. If we don't follow this structure and the order, we won't be able to form meaningful sentences and fail to communicate. Likewise, if we don't follow DOM, the browser won't be able to read and interpret the instructions on the screen, breaking down the communication.</p>

    <P>PS - Language is what we produce as a result of applying linguistics. Therefore, a website is what the user sees and interacts with, whereas HTML, CSS and DOM are the rules and structures behind the scenes that build a website</P>



    <p>What is meant by boxifying design? </p>
    <P>Boxifying design is thinking of design in boxes and placing the designs on a page in relation to the other boxes. Drawing boxes around each element on a website.</P>

    <p>What is the box model?</p>
    <P>The box model is positioning an element on a webpage in the form of a box with a margin, border, padding and content.</P>
