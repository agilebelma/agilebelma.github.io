    <p>What is grid-based design? </p>
    <p>Grid-based design is based on how our eyes follow patterns. We usually read by starting at the top, then left to right, then top to bottom (at least in Western cultures) We can create frames on a page and break them down to smaller grids, which enables us to move elements around a page.</p>

    <p> What's all the hype about responsive webpages?</p>
    <p>Due to varying resolutions of screens, we need to have an adaptive design to change the size of the pixels depending on the size of the screen on a device.</p>

    <p> What is semantic structure?</p>
    <p> Semantic structure defines the layout of the elements on the screen. For example, 'h1' is more prominent than 'h2'. Another element 'img' defines the image on the page. These labels tell the browser what the elements are on a page.</p>

    <p> Any other points?</p>
    <p> Frameworks: collections of CSS classes that make page layout easy to implement.</p>
    <p>12 column layout: 2, 3, 4 columns on a screen</p>
    <p>Display: flex; flex-wrap; wrap</p>
    <p> Box model: shows how elements are laid on the page.</p>
