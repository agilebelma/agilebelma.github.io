  <h4>What is a responsive site? Why is it important?</h4>
    <p>A responsive site is the one that adjusts to the browser in which the website is viewed, according to the screen resolution. It is important so that the viewer can have the same experience of interacting with the website regardless of the device or the screen size of the medium.</p>

  <h4> What is mobile first design? Why is it important?</h4>
    <p> It is a design consideration that takes into account of the dimensions of a mobile screen first (the smallest resolution). Then the larger resolution is incrementally added. It is important because it covers the smallest possible screen the website can be viewed in, the minimum dimensions.</p>

  <h4> What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h4>
    <p> Frameworks are collections of 'classes' that make page layout easy to implement (Udacity)</p>
    <p> In other words, a grouping of groups :-)</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Faster</li>
        <li>More Efficient</li>
        <li>Can be a steep learning curve</li>
        <li>Can be more comprehensive than your essential requirements</li>
      </ul>

  <h4> What is a wireframe? Why would you use it?</h4>
    <p>Wireframe is, as the name suggest, a frame made out of wire. So, it's minimal information displayed visually, to separate the different parts of your website</p>
