<h3> Explain to your non-technical friend:</h3>

<h4> How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
  <p>...JavaScript is to have interaction on the web site. Whereas HTML is for the structure and CSS is for the overall visual/aestethic set up.</p>

<h4> Control flows and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'.</h4>
  <p>...Control flow is similar to following a recipe when cooking. Occasionally, you can substitute some of the ingredients but strictly speaking, you follow the instructions to prepare a meal.</p>
  <p>.".. Loop control flow (while, do ...while, and for loops, repeat their bodies until a condition is met."(Brown, 2016) </p>

<h4> The difference between accessing data from arrays and objects.</h4>
  <p>"...Like arrays, objects in JavaScript are containers (also called aggregate or complex data types. Objects have two primary differences from arrays:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Arrays contain values, indexed numerically;objects contain properties, indexed by string or symbol.</li>
    <li>Arrays are ordered (arr[0] always comes before arr[1]); objects are not (you can't guarantee obj.a comes before obj.b).</li>
  </ul>
  <p>A property consists of a key (a string or symbol) and a value. What makes objects special is that you can access properties by their key."" (Brown, 2016: 145)</p>

<h4>What functions are and why they are useful.</h4>
  <p>"... A function is a self-contained collection of statements that run as a single unit: essentially, you can think of it as a subprogram." (Brown, 2016:101) </p>
