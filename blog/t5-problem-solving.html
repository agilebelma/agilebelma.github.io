<h3> Tell your non-technical friend a story about a time you:</h3>
<ol>
  <li>Got blocked on a simple problem</li>
  <li>Solved a problem in an elegant way</li>
</ol>
<h3> What was the problem? </h3>
<p>My very first JavaScript code, which didn't work. There were 3 circles on a page, and they were supposed to change colours as I hovered and/or clicked the mouse.</p>

<h3> What problem solving techniques did you use?</h3>
<p> First, I googled the problem. I came across forum posts. But the problem was so simple, I just couldn't find ot on Stack Overflow. Then I turned to my cohort, and I actually looked up someone else's code. All it was my curly bracket was facing the wrong way!</p>

<h3> How did you feel throughout the process?</h3>
<p>First, I felt frustrated. Then, silly for making such a stupid mistake! Then, I finally laughed at the situation, thinking, one day, maybe a year from now, I'll look back at this and reminisce. </p>

<h3> What did you learn?</h3>
<p> I learnt to be patient and be able to laugh at my silly mistakes. After all, it is all part of the learning process, right? I love having the support of my peers in my cohort. I really look forward to meeting them all in person, and working together to solve many more problems!</p>

<h3> How confident do you feel using the problem-solving techniques and processes?</h3>

<ul>
  <li>Pseudocode</li>
  <li>Trying something</li>
  <li>Rubber ducky method</li>
  <li>Reading error messages</li>
  <li>Console logging</li>
  <li>Googling</li>
  <li>Asking peers for help</li>
  <li>Asking coaches for help</li>
  <li>Improving your process with reflection</li>
</ul>

<h4>In order of usage and practice:</h4>

  <li>Trying something</li>

  <li>Asking peers for help</li>
  <li>Improving my process with reflection</li>

<h3> Explain to your non-technical friend:</h3>

<ul>
  <li>.map()</li>
  <li>.fileter()</li>
  <li>.reduce()</li>
</ul>

<h4> .map()</h4>
<p>As the name suggests, this JaveScript function 'maps out' to the items in the original array (list of items), and then carries out a task, a procedure for each item in that list, showing the results in a new array. </p>

<h4> .filter()</h4>
<p>This function 'checks' the items in the original array and passes them though a 'test'. If the items pass this test successfully, then they're placed in a new array.</p>

<h4> .reduce()</h4>
<p>I'm not exactly sure about this one. But I think it turns the original function into a smaller value, reading each item in an array from left to right.</p>
