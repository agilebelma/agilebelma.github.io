<h4> What is 'scope' and how does it work in JavaScript?</h4>

  <p> Ok, here's my interpretation. But first, a declaration (pun intended). I have googled the term, watched videos, read articles, scanned Stack Overflow but this blog post is purely my own definition. So apologies for misleading you. </p>

    <h5>There are two types of scope in JavaScript</h5>

      <h6> Global Scope</h6>
      <p>When you create but do not declare a variable, your code will be read and 'executed' at top level, throughout the whole programme.</p>
      <p>JavaScript 'thingy' will read and execute your code as a blanket rule, applying the same variable throughout your programme. YOur variable will be same value every where on your programme (the Window level).</p>

      <h6> Local Scope</h6>
      <p> When you create and declare (assign value) a variable within a function, or a method, then the JavaScript 'thingy' will look for and execute it at that level (the Document level).</p>

      <p>DOcument belongs to the Window</p>

      <p>In other words:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Declare your variables as you create them</li>
        <li>If not feasible, then create them at function level</li>
        <li>Local scope will be applicable to the function that is created, in a container of its own (nothing else can read that variable other than the function it is created in)</li>
        <li>Global scope over-rides local scope</li>
      </ul>

      <p> I have no idea what I'm talking about, right?</p>
